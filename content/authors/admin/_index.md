Keeping myself sober to avoid falling in the [drunkard's search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect). Problems don't care about borders and neither should we. I'm interested in the economic implications of climate change and the energy transition. Particularly the [diffusion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.030) and [integration](https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.2988) of variable renewables in [wholesale](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2019.104552) and [retail](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.019) electricity markets. Also interested in [development](http://journals.univ-danubius.ro/index.php/euroeconomica/article/view/2514/2510), [political economy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301703616300062) and [interdisciplinary research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162517302706?via%3Dihub)
