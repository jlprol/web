abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016.This study revives the analytical capacity of the profit-investment ratio to explain economic growth in Spain between 1994 and 2007 from a post-Keynesian perspective. The analytical framework revolves around the variables that determine profit and accumulation rates. An aggregate analysis of the Spanish economy confirms a positive ratio between profit and accumulation rates. However, a disaggregate analysis (seven sectors) shows that this positive relationship is only present in the two sectors tied to the real estate bubble (construction and financial services), which also drove economic growth during this time period, and the mining-supplies sector. This outcome allows us to characterize the development model followed by the Spanish economy during this time period.},
